Given exceptionally long lead times for repair parts delivery, I used MS Access (my first awkward foray into databases) to analyze and pre-order repair parts to enable rapid turnaround of repairs.\nIn a completely different domain, I was also a military policeman aboard Camp Pendleton, and a sub-standard Korean translator that served in two Foal Eagle exercises. =)",
